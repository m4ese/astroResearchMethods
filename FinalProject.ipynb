    "The paper \"Discovery of a White Dwarf Companion to HD 159062\" by Hirsch et al. used radial velocity (RV) data to prove the existence of a white dwarf companion to the late G dwarf star, HD 159062. Although a white dwarf companion to HD 159602 was alluded to in Fuhrmann et all. in 2017, Hirsch et al. were the first to properly observe and report on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The RV data used in this paper was collected by the HIRES at the W.M Keck Observatory over 14 years. Further multi-epoch, multi-band imaging observations were used from the ShaneAO system at Lick Observatory, PHARO at Palomar Observatory, and NIRC2 at Keck observatory. The authors of this paper primarily worked with and manipulated the data to obtain their results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can access this data through $\\href{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+159062}{SIMBAD}$ (an astronomical database)\n",
    "\n",
    "- HIRES data (I): To reduce the spectra, a CPS pipeline was used. For each epoch, the absorption lines from starlight in cells containing molecular iodine were used as a high-fidelity wavelength calibration and PSF reference. The radial velocity and its uncertainties were then extracted for each chunk of the spectrum per epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ShaneAO data: Hirsch et al. used images in the $K_s$ band from the ShaneAO system. The primary star's PSF was subtracted from the image to obtain relative flux values for it as well as its companion using a high-pass filtered version of the original image. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Keck/NIRC2 data:  Images of HD 159062 in the $L'$ band were used as well, taken wiht Keck NIRC2. Sky background frames were subtracted from each frame indivudally. Principal component analysis was used to estimate and subtract the stellar contribution from the images. A copy of the off-axis PSF at the location of the white dwarf was subtracted as well. These steps were repeated to produce an image where the companion star was clearly resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Putting the data together: the RV data obtained from the HIRES observations was finally used to rule out HD 159062 B as a brown dwarf. Newton's second law was used to obtain its mass, found to be larger than the upper limit on brown dwarfs. Furthermore, the colors from the images in infrared show that the star is not a brown dwarf. However, the images and measurement of its mass are consistent with those of a white dwarf, solidifying the companion star's classification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- On the implications of the results: HD 159062 is a main sequence star, unique for Ba stars (which are typically G and K giants). The separation between HD 159062 and its companion star is wider than other known binaries of Ba or CH stars, and its orbital period is much longer as well. These results might be consistent with a process in which the white dwarf is \"kicked\" as it is formed. The unique propreties of this binary system suggest that there may be more binary systems that share these qualities that we have simply yet to identify, maybe due to this extra-large separation and faintness of the companion in images that have yet to be manipulated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In conclusion, the authors of the paper resolved telescope images through python programming to reveal a bright spot near HD 159062 (its companion). The methods, packages, and algorithms used were not novel, taken from a number of previously published papers (eg: QACITS tip-tilt control algorith - Huby et al. 2017, principal component analysis - Sounmer et al. 2012, Vortex Image Processing (VIP) software package - Gomez Gonzales et al.). Through their manipulation of the images, the authors of this paper were indeed able to prove the existence of a white dwarf companion star to HD 159062.\n",

    "- The radial velocity method (also known as Doppler spectroscopy) uses the electromagnetic spectrum to obtain the velocity of stars. A high resolution spectrum is taken for a given star and its wavelengths are compared to those obtained in a laboratory condition. Through the shift of the wavelengths of the star's spectrum relative to those in the lab, the star's radial velocity can be obtained. If the wavelengths are shifted towards the red, the star is moving away from us, and if they are shifted towards blue, it is moving towards us. The formula for obtaining the raidal velocity is then $$\\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0=v_r/c$$ with $\\lambda_0$ = the wavelength measured in laboratory conditions, $\\Delta\\lambda$ = the separation between the two wavelengths, $v_r$ = the radial velocity, and c = light speed. The radial velocity method is useful fordetecting exoplanets and revealing some properties of binary systems of stars. The practical difficulties with this method are that it is not necessarily accurate when observing multiple stars or systems at once (as it may produce false signals) and it can only provide a lower bound on the mass of very distant stars. Furthermore, it can only be used to detect velocities that are perpendicular to earth, and is useless in cases where the plane of a star's orbit is parallel to earth (face-on when observed). Finally, variations in a star's brightness can lead to inconsistencies in measurements made using the radial velocity method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The direct imaging method works by removing the glare of bright stars in images to reveal fainter exoplanets orbiting them. This method is extremely useful in helping to identify exoplanets directly, and can even help reveal their composition. The difficulties with this method are that it only works with stars of a specific wavelength (at infrared), because stars at this wavelength are typically only one million times brighter than a planet reflecting their light, while stars emitting lights at visible wavelength will typically be one billion times brighter than a planet reflecting their light. Furthermore, because the star is so much brighter than its companion, this method can only be uses when an exoplanet is either massive or orbiting far enough away from its star. Due to this necessary balance between a star's brightness and its orbiting exoplanet, this method can only be used in very specific, rare instances."
